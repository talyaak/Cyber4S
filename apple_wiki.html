            <h1 id="Top">Apple</h1>
            <p>
                An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide
                and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
                ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and
                Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological
                significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
                Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently
                lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks.
                Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are
                used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.
                There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses,
                including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial,
                and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's
                genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
                Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total

            <h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
            <p>The word apple, formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from the Proto-Germanic root *ap(a)laz, which
                could also mean fruit in general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *ab(e)l-, but the precise
                original meaning and the relationship between both words[clarification needed] is uncertain.
                As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than berries but
                including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle English word appel of paradis, meaning a banana. This use is
                analogous to the French language use of pomme.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
            <p>The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30
                ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and
                trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and
                slightly downy undersides.<br /><br />

                Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some
                long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five
                petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is
                called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.<br /><br />

                The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes.
                Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market
                preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4
                in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally
                red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found. The skin may
                also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of
                epicuticular wax. The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white, though pink, yellow or green
                exocarps also occur.

            <!-- 'Wild ancestors' is a sub-paragraph -->
            <h3>Wild ancestors</h3>
            <p>The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains of Central
                Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China. Cultivation of the species,
                most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time
                and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant
                exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to
                crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent
                admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.
            </p>

            <!-- Genome is also a sub-paragraph -->
            <h3>Genome</h3>
            <p>Apple is diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), has 17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of
                approximately 650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been made available, the first one in 2010 was based
                on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'. However, this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain
                several errors in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination
                with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently, double- and trihaploid individuals have
                been sequenced, yielding whole genome sequences of higher quality. The first whole genome assembly was
                estimated to contain around 57,000 genes, though the more recent genome sequences support more moderate
                estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes. Among other things, the availability of whole
                genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus
                sieversii. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting extensive
                introgression from Malus sylvestris following domestication.
            </p>

            <h2 id="History">History</h2>
            <p>Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the cultivated apple, and is morphologically
                similar. Due to the genetic variability in Central Asia, this region is generally considered the center of
                origin for apples. The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4000–10000 years ago in the Tian Shan
                mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization and introgression of
                wild crabapples from Siberia (M. baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M. sylvestris). Only the M.
                sieversii trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the
                domesticated apple, not the isolated population on the eastern side.<br /><br />

                Chinese soft apples, such as M. asiatica and M. prunifolia, have been cultivated as dessert apples for more than
                2000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between M. baccata and M. sieversii in
                Kazakhstan.<br /><br />

                Among the traits selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble sugar.
                Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild M. sieversii origin is only slightly smaller than the modern
                domesticated apple.<br /><br />

                At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found
                in material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE. Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used to
                determine whether such ancient apples were wild Malus sylvestris or Malus domesticus containing Malus sieversii
                ancestry. It is generally also hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples
                and apple plantations.<br /><br />

                There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was
                substantial apple production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was certainly known then.
                Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best
                cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.<br /><br />

                Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and
                Europe for millennia. Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the
                16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted. Apples were introduced to North America by
                colonists in the 17th century, and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in
                Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625. The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which
                were once called "common apples". Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native
                American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery
                catalogue sold 350 of the "best" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the
                early 19th century. In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the
                development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.<br /><br />

                Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for
                sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.
                Controlled atmosphere facilities are used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use
                high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness. They were first
                used in the United States in the 1960s.<br /><br />
